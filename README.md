## How to Use ##

Multiple imports/modules are needed. It is recommended that a terminal-based virtual environment is used to run this program, although if the necessary installations have already been made then it is not necessary.

### Virtual Environment Instructions ###

The command to create a virtual environment is:

`$ python3 -m venv <your-env>`

The command to activate your new virtual environment is:

`$ source <your-env>/bin/activate`

Entering a virtual environment within your terminal allows you to install packages/modules there alone, rather to your entire computer.

The command to deactivate the virtual environment is:

`$ deactivate`

### Installations and Modules ###

Below is a list of the commands necessary to complete the proper installations necessary to run the program, followed by instructions on how to run it:

`$ <your-env>/bin/pip install google-api-python-client` – to install the 'googleapiclient' module

`$ <your-env>/bin/pip install pillow` – to install the 'PIL' module

`$ <your-env>/bin/pip install pandas` – to install the 'pandas' module

`$ <your-env>/bin/pip install matplotlib` – to install the 'matplotlib' module

If any other modules have not been installed, it is likely that replacing the final argument in the above commands with the missing module will make the proper installation. Otherwise, try the full name of the module if it is abbreviated (similar to PIL and pillow) or search for the proper method on Google.

### Running Instructions ###

Python3 is required to run. Command to run:

`$ python3 gui.py`

Exit out of the window to quit.

Our team was pressed for time, so our demonstration video is admittedly unprofessional. Nevertheless, it shows the variety of functions and capabilities we implemented alongside our committment to the full, well-rounded completion of our project.
